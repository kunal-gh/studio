## Design Philosophy

Inspired by Picasso's artistic periods with a cubist-influenced aesthetic:
- Desaturated blue palette (#87CEEB) evoking tranquility
- Muted orange-yellow accents (#E07A5F) for highlights
- Non-traditional layouts that break conventional structures
- Scroll-triggered animations including zoom effects and cubist-style image transformations
- Background animations using blended photo sequences
