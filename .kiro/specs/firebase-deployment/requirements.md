# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for deploying the "Through Hardik's Eye" photography portfolio website to Firebase App Hosting. The deployment process must ensure the Next.js application is properly built, configured, and deployed to Firebase's infrastructure with all necessary dependencies and configurations in place.

## Glossary

- **Firebase_App_Hosting**: Google's managed hosting service for web applications that provides automatic scaling, SSL certificates, and CDN distribution
- **Next.js_Application**: The React-based web framework application that renders the photography portfolio
- **Firebase_CLI**: Command-line interface tool for managing Firebase projects and deployments
- **Build_Artifacts**: The compiled and optimized production files generated by the Next.js build process
- **Firestore_Database**: Firebase's NoSQL cloud database storing photographs and testimonials data
- **Node_Environment**: The local development environment with Node.js and npm installed

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify the local environment has all necessary tools installed, so that the deployment process can proceed without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deployment process begins, THE Node_Environment SHALL verify Node.js version 18 or higher is installed
2. WHEN the deployment process begins, THE Node_Environment SHALL verify npm package manager is available
3. WHEN Firebase CLI is not detected, THE Node_Environment SHALL install firebase-tools globally
4. WHEN environment verification completes, THE Node_Environment SHALL report all tool versions to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to install all project dependencies, so that the application can be built successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependency installation is initiated, THE Node_Environment SHALL execute npm install command
2. WHEN dependencies are being installed, THE Node_Environment SHALL download all packages listed in package.json
3. IF dependency installation fails, THEN THE Node_Environment SHALL report the specific error to the user
4. WHEN installation completes successfully, THE Node_Environment SHALL verify node_modules directory exists

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to initialize Firebase configuration, so that the project is connected to the correct Firebase project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Firebase initialization begins, THE Firebase_CLI SHALL authenticate the user with Firebase account
2. WHEN project selection is required, THE Firebase_CLI SHALL connect to project "studio-6358494429-d141f"
3. WHEN Firebase features are configured, THE Firebase_CLI SHALL enable App Hosting and Firestore
4. WHEN initialization completes, THE Firebase_CLI SHALL create firebase.json and .firebaserc configuration files
5. WHEN Firestore rules exist, THE Firebase_CLI SHALL deploy firestore.rules to the database

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to build the Next.js application for production, so that optimized static and server assets are generated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process starts, THE Next.js_Application SHALL compile all TypeScript files to JavaScript
2. WHEN building pages, THE Next.js_Application SHALL optimize all React components for production
3. WHEN processing images, THE Next.js_Application SHALL configure remote image patterns for external sources
4. WHEN the build completes, THE Next.js_Application SHALL generate Build_Artifacts in the .next directory
5. IF build errors occur, THEN THE Next.js_Application SHALL report compilation errors with file locations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy the application to Firebase App Hosting, so that the website is accessible to users on the internet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment is initiated, THE Firebase_CLI SHALL upload Build_Artifacts to Firebase_App_Hosting
2. WHEN uploading files, THE Firebase_CLI SHALL transfer all static assets and server functions
3. WHEN deployment is processing, THE Firebase_CLI SHALL configure the hosting environment per apphosting.yaml settings
4. WHEN deployment completes successfully, THE Firebase_CLI SHALL provide the live website URL
5. WHEN deployment finishes, THE Firebase_App_Hosting SHALL serve the application with SSL enabled

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify the deployed application works correctly, so that I can confirm users can access all features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN verification begins, THE Firebase_App_Hosting SHALL respond to HTTP requests with status code 200
2. WHEN the homepage loads, THE Next.js_Application SHALL render the hero section with animated images
3. WHEN Firestore is queried, THE Firestore_Database SHALL return photographs and testimonials data
4. WHEN users navigate, THE Next.js_Application SHALL load all portfolio category pages without errors
5. WHEN the contact form is accessed, THE Next.js_Application SHALL display the form with all input fields

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to handle deployment failures gracefully, so that I can troubleshoot and retry the deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF any deployment step fails, THEN THE Firebase_CLI SHALL log the error message with context
2. IF authentication fails, THEN THE Firebase_CLI SHALL prompt for re-authentication
3. IF build fails, THEN THE Next.js_Application SHALL display the specific compilation error
4. IF network issues occur, THEN THE Firebase_CLI SHALL retry the upload operation up to 3 times
5. WHEN errors are resolved, THE Firebase_CLI SHALL allow resuming deployment from the failed step
